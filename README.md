# Extract-Data-from-Twitter-by-API
Use Twitter API for Python to download tweets, search tweets by hashtags, extract metadata such as a number of retweets, etc.<br>
In this project, **tweepy** package was used for all those tasks mentioned above. The package could access twitter **api.get_user**, which can get a user's profile information; **api.user_timeline**, which is to get tweets from a specified user's timeline and **api.search**, which is to search for tweets containing a specific keyowrd or hashtag. <br>
It is a group project, thanks to my team mates: Chole Qi, Max Ng, Jiaying Zhu, Yirui Chen and Zheng Gong.
